### Source Code

<br><br>Ok, I wrote too much this time. PSC said I have too many characters. Dang. So, you will have to go to the ZIP this time. In the ZIP I have the HTML document for the article and also the source files for the DLL it walks you through making. While you can just refer to my files for that, when you get to the end where we use the DLL, you will still have to compile my code, then follow the article to make the test project showing how to use the DLL.
